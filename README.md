This is a complete documentation for a library management system, including the tech stack used, frontend and backend project structure, user and admin views, API usage, and backend authentication and authorization.

The frontend tech stack uses JS as the programming language, Thymeleaf as the Java template engine, Bootstrap 4 as the CSS framework, and the Open Library API and Leaflet Maps API for APIs.

The backend uses Spring Core for dependency injection and inversion of control, Spring MVC as a web framework, Spring Data JPA for data access layer development, Spring Security for authentication and authorization, and Tomcat Server as the Java-based web server and servlet container.
